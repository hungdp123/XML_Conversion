# XML_Conversion

My work project: Converting XML data from various data sources to WOVOml format using Python ElementTree.

Two data sources that I have been working on:
1. [ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/): contains earthquake source parameters (e.g. hypocenters, magnitudes, phase picks and amplitudes) and other products (e.g. moment tensor solutions, macroseismic information, tectonic summaries, maps) produced by contributing seismic networks.
2. [ISC Bulletin](http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/catalogue/): The Bulletin of the International Seismological Centre is the primary output of the ISC and is regarded as the definitive record of the Earth's seismicity. The ISC Bulletin contains data from 1900 to present day (2021-02-16). The Reviewed ISC Bulletin, which is manually checked by ISC analysts and relocated (when there are sufficient data) is typically 24 months behind real-time and is currently up to 2018-11-01.
